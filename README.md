In order to build the app, we used an external API to get the questions and answers: [OpenTriviaDB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

Then we wireframed our app in Figma:

We then set up a board in Jira, where we added the tasks we needed to work on in order to complete the project:

*The last step is to publish it and we chose to use Netlify to host our app:*
